<h1>Heather's Favourite Fortnite Loadout</h1>
    <h2>These are mostly because I have been influenced by <i>Twitch</i> Streamers</h2>

    <hr />
        <h3>1. Flare Gun</h3>
            <p>Very good for seeing where your enemies are during a fight or just when you are roaming. <br />
                <i>They have removed them in the new update though lads. </i></p>

        <h3>2. MK Alpha Assault Rifle</h3>
                <p>This is the best AR in the game. Sometimes streamers choose a white one of these over a different <b>mythic</b> AR.</p>

        <h3>3. Drum Shotgun</h3>
                <p>A controversial one. But you can't doubt that it's good!</p>
